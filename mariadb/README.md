## About

You can use this add-on to install MariaDB, which is an open-source (GPLv2 licensed) database.  MariaDB can be used as the database backend for Home Assistant. For more information, please see [MariaDB][mariadb]

If you are trying to minimize your SD-card's wear by using the built-in SQLite with `db_url: 'sqlite:///:memory:'` recorder configuration but fed up with the uncountable `[homeassistant.components.recorder.util] Error executing query: (sqlite3.OperationalError) cannot commit - no transaction is active` errors in your HA log, give this add-on a try.

It will also protect you from the data loss caused by HA core restarts when in-memory SQLite used. Though it won't protect you from power failures, add-on or host restarts or updates.

This version uses **tmpfs** to store MariaDB databases in-memory. The default ~~InnoDB~~ storage engine is replaced with **Aria** storage engine.

Background:
- InnoDB storage engine wastes a great amount of disk space, but the only storage engine that is compatible with recorder. Memory storage engine [can't handle TEXT columns][memory-storage-engine] and Aria storage engine [can't handle foreign keys][aria-storage-engine] in the recorder [database][schema], MyRocks storage engine (though it has compression) [is not available for 32-bit platforms][myrocks-storage-engine].
- The official [database schema][schema] is modified and created before the recorder tries to create it. The `entity_id` and `state` column's length reduced from 255 to 128 char (they were too long for Aria keys), and 2 foreign keys are removed (Aria can't handle them).

**See the Documentation tab for the required configuration changes for the recorder integration!!!**
